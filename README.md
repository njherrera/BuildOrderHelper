# BuildOrderHelper
This program uses an HTML parsing API to extract a "build order" (real time strategy term, essentially meaning a player's opening sequence) from the website lotv.spawningpool.com, then use a timer to give the user real-time directions.

This project could be developed further, possibly into a program that runs within the game itself, but at the moment this is very low on my list of priorities as far as projects to work on go.
